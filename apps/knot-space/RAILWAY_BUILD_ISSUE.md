# üöÇ Railway SQLx Build Issue & Solutions

## The Problem

Railway's Docker build environment has a **fundamental limitation** with SQLx compile-time query verification:

1. **Railway provides `DATABASE_URL`** during Docker build
2. **Database hostname is internal**: `postgres-zimf.railway.internal`  
3. **Build containers cannot access internal database** during build phase
4. **SQLx `query!` macros require database connection** to verify queries at compile time
5. **Build fails** with "Name or service not known" errors

## Railway Build Log Evidence

```
DATABASE_URL provided: Testing database connectivity...
Extracted DB host: postgres-zimf.railway.internal
‚ùå Database not accessible during build, using offline mode...
Compiling knot-space v0.1.0 (/app)
error: `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` but there is no cached data for this query
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Railway Architecture Issue
- **Build Phase**: Isolated container, no access to internal services
- **Runtime Phase**: Full network access to internal services  
- **SQLx Requirement**: Database access during compilation for `query!` macro verification

### SQLx Compile-Time Verification
- **Online Mode**: Requires live database connection during `cargo build`
- **Offline Mode**: Requires pre-generated `sqlx-data.json` with query cache
- **Current Issue**: Neither mode works in Railway's build environment

## Solutions

### üéØ **Solution 1: Pre-Generated SQLx Cache (Recommended)**

**Generate `sqlx-data.json` locally and commit to repository:**

```bash
# Set up local database
createdb knot_local
psql knot_local -f migrations/001_init.sql

# Generate query cache
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user@localhost/knot_local"
cargo sqlx prepare

# Commit the generated file
git add sqlx-data.json
git commit -m "Add SQLx query cache for Railway deployment"
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly with Railway
- ‚úÖ Fast builds (no database connection needed)
- ‚úÖ Compile-time query verification
- ‚úÖ Type safety maintained

**Dockerfile remains:**
```dockerfile
ENV SQLX_OFFLINE=true
RUN cargo build --release
```

### üîß **Solution 2: Runtime Query Verification**

**Modify code to use runtime query building instead of compile-time macros:**

```rust
// Instead of: sqlx::query!(...)
// Use: sqlx::query(...)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Works with Railway
- ‚ùå No compile-time query verification  
- ‚ùå Less type safety
- ‚ùå Requires significant code changes

### üåê **Solution 3: Alternative Platforms**

**Deploy to platforms with build-time database access:**
- **Render**: Provides build-time database access
- **Fly.io**: Can configure build-time connectivity
- **Self-hosted**: Full control over build environment

## Recommendation

**Use Solution 1** - it's the most pragmatic approach that:
- Maintains all SQLx benefits
- Works reliably with Railway  
- Requires minimal changes
- Provides the best developer experience

## Implementation Steps

1. **Local Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install PostgreSQL locally
   brew install postgresql
   brew services start postgresql
   
   # Create development database  
   createdb knot_dev
   psql knot_dev -f apps/knot-space/migrations/001_init.sql
   ```

2. **Generate SQLx Cache**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/knot-space
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$(whoami)@localhost/knot_dev"
   cargo sqlx prepare
   ```

3. **Commit & Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git add sqlx-data.json
   git commit -m "Add SQLx query cache for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Railway Deploy**:
   - Railway detects changes
   - Builds with `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`
   - Uses `sqlx-data.json` for query verification
   - ‚úÖ **Build succeeds!**

## Status

This is **not a bug** in our code or Railway - it's an architectural limitation of SQLx's compile-time verification in containerized build environments where the database is not accessible during the build phase.

The solution is well-established in the Rust/SQLx community and is the recommended approach for containerized deployments.
