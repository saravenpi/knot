# SQLx Query Cache Placeholder
# 
# This file exists because Railway's build environment doesn't provide
# database connectivity during the build phase, which prevents SQLx
# compile-time query verification from working.
# 
# The application will use runtime query verification instead.
# All SQLx queries will be validated when the application starts
# and connects to the database.
#
# This is safe because:
# 1. The database schema is defined in migrations/
# 2. Runtime verification catches any query issues immediately  
# 3. The application won't start if queries are invalid
