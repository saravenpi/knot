# Basic Variable Interpolation Examples
# This file contains examples of simple variable interpolation patterns

variables:
  project_name: "awesome-project"
  version: "2.1.0"
  author: "saravenpi"
  description: "An awesome project built with Knot"
  build_tool: "turbo"
  package_manager: "bun"

# Simple string interpolation
name: ${project_name}
version: ${version}
author: ${author}
description: ${description}

# Multiple variables in single values
full_name: "${project_name} v${version}"
attribution: "Created by ${author}"
build_command: "${package_manager} run ${build_tool}"

# Variables in different data types
metadata:
  name: ${project_name}
  version: ${version}
  created_by: ${author}

# Variables in arrays
tags:
  - ${project_name}
  - "version-${version}"
  - ${build_tool}

# Variables in object keys and values
scripts:
  build: "${build_tool} run build"
  test: "${build_tool} run test"
  dev: "${package_manager} run dev"
  version: "echo ${version}"

# Quoted vs unquoted interpolation
config:
  app_name: ${project_name}           # Unquoted - preserves type
  app_version: "${version}"           # Quoted - always string
  port: 3000                          # Static value
  debug: true                         # Static boolean
